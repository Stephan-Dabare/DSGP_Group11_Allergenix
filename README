Overview
This repository contains data and supporting files for a multi-label allergy prediction model. The files included are:

final_dataset.csv: The cleaned and processed dataset containing combined text features (ingredients_text and additives_en) and binary-encoded labels for various allergens.
mlb.pkl: A serialized MultiLabelBinarizer object used for encoding and decoding the multi-label allergy classification data.


File Descriptions
1. final_dataset.csv
  Purpose:
  This file is the primary dataset used to train, validate, and test a BERT-based model for allergy prediction. It combines the ingredients and additives of food items into a single text field (combined_text) and includes binary-encoded allergy labels.

Structure:
  The dataset contains the following columns:

    combined_text: A string field that combines ingredients_text and additives_en. This serves as the input feature for the model.
    [Allergen Labels]: Binary columns, where each column corresponds to a specific allergen (e.g., Nut Allergy, Gluten Allergy, etc.).
    1: Indicates the allergen is present.
    0: Indicates the allergen is absent.

2. mlb.pkl
  Purpose:
  This file contains the serialized MultiLabelBinarizer object used for encoding and decoding the multi-label allergy data.

Description:

  The MultiLabelBinarizer is a scikit-learn utility that transforms a list of allergy labels into a binary format and vice versa.
  During training, the mlb was fitted to the list of unique allergen classes extracted from the original dataset.
  This ensures consistency between the training and inference phases when handling allergy labels.
